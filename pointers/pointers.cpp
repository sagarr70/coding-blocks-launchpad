/*    Addition of an address by a constant integer value i.e. ptr +5 means
address of cell which is 5 * sizeof(*ptr) away from ptr.
Similar for subtraction
Again Multiplying/Dividing an address with some constant value
doesnâ€™t make any sense
Subtracting two address of same type would give you number of
elements between them.
